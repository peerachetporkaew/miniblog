## Predict then Propagate:

A PyTorch implementation of "Predict then Propagate: Graph Neural Networks meet Personalized PageRank" (ICLR 2019). APPNP is a node-level semi-supervised learning algorithm which has near state-of-the-art performance on most standard node classification datasets. It can be used for tasks such as document labelling, malware detection, churn prediction and so on.

> Idea : 
Can this implement in Machine Translation (Ontology + NMT)

Great !
